For me, Ghibli's art represents a philosophy I strive to embody in my own work: the seamless integration of intricate technology with a deep, unwavering humanity. Their films find wonder in both handcrafted flying machines and quiet moments in the rain, reminding us that the most powerful creations are those that feel accessible, thoughtful, and fundamentally human.",
